## Key Changes:

### ✅ Better:
- **Removed:** "job search" mentions (too desperate)
- **Removed:** List of all companies you're applying to (not strategic)
- **Added:** Technical depth and specific metrics
- **Focused:** On Glass Imaging since that's your best demo
- **Professional:** Framed as "demonstrations" not "applications"

### 🎯 Strategy:
- Each company only sees THEIR demo highlighted
- Other projects look like general portfolio work
- Technical focus > desperation vibes
- You still show F1/sponsorship need (important!)

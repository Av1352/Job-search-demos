# 🤖 AI Code Review Agent - Built with Langbase

Custom demo built for **Langbase** to demonstrate understanding of their serverless AI platform and composable agent architecture.

## 🎯 Purpose

Show Langbase founders that I:
1. Understand their "Pipes" agent architecture
2. Can build with their SDK quickly
3. Get their "AI for all developers" vision
4. Can ship production-quality demos

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Langbase SDK** - Serverless AI agent platform
- **JavaScript** - Frontend logic
- **HTML/CSS** - UI
- **Netlify Functions** - Secure API key handling

## ✨ Features

- Code review for multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, SQL)
- Bug detection
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance analysis
- Best practices checking
- Pre-loaded example snippets

## 🏗️ Architecture

Uses Langbase's **Pipe** primitive to create a serverless AI agent with:
- Structured prompting for code analysis
- Memory for consistent review patterns
- Composable architecture (no bloated frameworks)

## 📸 Screenshots

## 🔧 Local Development
```bash
# Open index.html in browser (for testing)
open index.html

# For production (with Netlify Functions):
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify dev
```

## 💡 What I Learned

- Langbase's approach to serverless AI is cleaner than LangChain
- Composable primitives > monolithic frameworks
- Their SDK makes agent orchestration trivial
- Memory (RAG) integration is powerful for context

## 📝 Notes for Langbase Team

Built this in ~2 hours to demonstrate:
1. Quick learning ability
2. Understanding of your product vision
3. Production-ready code quality
4. Alignment with your "build, ship, iterate" philosophy

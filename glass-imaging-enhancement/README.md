3. Set SDK to "Gradio"
4. Your app will be live in minutes!

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Enhancement Pipeline
```
Input Image
    ↓
1. Denoising (Optional)
   - Non-local Means Denoising
   - Reduces noise while preserving edges
    ↓
2. Color Space Conversion
   - RGB → LAB
   - Separates luminance from color
    ↓
3. CLAHE on Luminance
   - Adaptive histogram equalization
   - Enhances local contrast
    ↓
4. Multi-stage Enhancement
   - Brightness boost (+20%)
   - Contrast increase (+30%)
   - Color saturation (+15%)
   - Sharpness enhancement (+40%)
    ↓
Enhanced Output
```

### Why These Techniques?

**CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**
- Prevents over-amplification in bright/dark regions
- Maintains natural appearance
- Used in medical imaging and computational photography

**LAB Color Space**
- Separates brightness from color information
- Allows independent enhancement of luminance and chrominance
- Prevents color shifting during enhancement

**Non-local Means Denoising**
- Preserves fine details while removing noise
- Works across similar patches in the image
- Essential for low-light photography

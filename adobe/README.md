### Why Adobe?

I'm passionate about building production-ready multi-agent systems that solve real business problems. Adobe's Agent Orchestrator represents the cutting edge of enterprise AI - moving beyond single LLM calls to coordinated, specialized agents that work together like a high-performing team.

My background in ML engineering (medical imaging, computer vision, MLOps) has given me experience building complex AI systems. The challenge of designing agents that collaborate effectively, share context intelligently, and produce reliable business outcomes is exactly the kind of problem I want to solve at scale.

Adobe's vision for agentic AI in customer experience aligns perfectly with where I see the future of enterprise AI heading - specialized, coordinated, and deeply integrated with business workflows.
